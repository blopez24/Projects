Project Proposal

Project Idea:
With happiness being a subjective concept, everyone everywhere has different forms of happiness and that can be influenced by various factors. We are going to explore how two factors (economy and life expectancy) can influence a country's value of happiness.

Members:
Bryan Lopez and Matthew Oey and Max Grieser

Domain:
Using the data sets, making models for both GDP and life expectancy and how that would contribute to the future of each countryâ€™s happiness.
